# Course Outline

This is an advanced course about the design and analysis of algorithms.
The main topics covered in this course are:

- Randomized algorithms and probabilistic analysis
- Amortized analysis
- Coping with NP-hard problems
    - Exponential-time algorithms
    - Fixed-parameter tractable algorithms
    - Approximation algorithms

# Important Dates

**Notice:** There will be no class this Thursday March 9th.  I'm away at a conference and don't have a replacement lecturer for Thursday.  However, we're not losing a lecture, since the semester has 24 lectures but because we started on a Thursday, we have 25 scheduled.

Please use the time to work on Assignment 3 instead.  If you're struggling with amortized analysis, consider watching the material presented by one of the best in the business:
