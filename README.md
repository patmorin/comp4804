These are the resources for my course COMP4804: Algoritms II.

If you have a Python3 installation with the markdown and pygments modules,
you can make all the HTML files using

    make

If you want auto-hyphenation in the resulting HTML (recommended), use

    git clone git@github.com:mnater/Hyphenator.git

If you have the appropriate version of ipe, you can make the svg figures, though they're already included in the repository.

    make svg
